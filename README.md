It provides both GET and POST endpoints to add two numbers and perform other basic calculations. Additionally, a frontend HTML page allows users to interact with these endpoints through a web form.

## Features

- **GET /add**: Adds two numbers provided as query parameters.
- **POST /calculate**: Performs basic calculator operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) based on JSON payload.
- **Frontend HTML Page**: Allows users to test the endpoints through a web interface.

## Prerequisites
